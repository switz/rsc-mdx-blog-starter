Code + Syntax Highlighting built in (server rendered via Bright).

```tsx
const foo = 1;
```

We have bleeding (move outside of the blog container for effect). And open-graph images (for social cards).

<Image src="/complex-post/opengraph-image" alt="opengraph image" width={720} height="390" className='bleed' />

And inline footnotes<Footnote content="Hello!" /> for easy reading.
