import Image from 'next/image';

Directories work too.

Code + Syntax Highlighting built in (server rendered via Bright). With tabs/titles if you want them.

```tsx
// title hello.js
const foo = 1;
```

We have content bleeding (content can expand outside of the blog container for effect). And open-graph images (for social cards).

<Image src="/complex-post/opengraph-image" alt="opengraph image" width={720} height="390" className='bleed' />

And inline footnotes<Footnote content="Hello!" /> for easy reading.

What do you think.
